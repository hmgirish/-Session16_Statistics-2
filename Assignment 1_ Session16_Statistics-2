A test is conducted which is consisting of 20 MCQs (multiple choices questions) with every MCQ having its four options
out of which only one is correct. Determine the probability that a person undertaking that test has answered exactly 
5 questions wrong.

Solution:

Here, n = 20, n - k = 5, k = 20 - 5 = 15

Here the probability of success = probability of giving a right answer = s = 1/4

Hence, the probability of failure = probability of giving a wrong answer = 1 - s = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4

When we substitute these values in the formula for Binomial distribution we get,

So, P (exactly 5 out of 20 answers incorrect) = C (20, 5) * (1/4)^15 * (3/4)^5

→	P (5 out of 20) = (20∗19∗18∗17∗16)/(5∗4∗3∗2∗1) * (1/4)^15 * (3/4)^5

= 0.0000034 (approximately)
